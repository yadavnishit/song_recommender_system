# Song_recommender_system

Song Recommender System (Based on Artist Name)
This project recommends songs by analyzing artist similarity. Enter an artistâ€™s name, and it returns a list of songs from artists with similar musical style or metadata.

ðŸŽ¯ What It Does
Type in an artist name, and it suggests songs from other similar artists. It's a content-based filtering approach, working entirely from the metadataâ€”no user data required.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Dataset: Includes artist names, song titles, and other metadata (genres, features, etc.)

Preprocessing: Cleans and filters data to focus on relevant info (artist, song name, etc.)

Vectorization: Transforms artist names into numerical format using CountVectorizer

Similarity Matching: Uses cosine similarity to find similar artists

Recommendations: Fetches top N similar artists and returns some of their songs

(Output depends on actual dataset used. Placeholder example above.)

ðŸ“Œ Limitations
Works only with artists present in the dataset

Doesnâ€™t account for user taste or song lyrics

Artist similarity is based on name/metadata, not actual music/audio features

ðŸ“ˆ Future Ideas
Add audio features (e.g. tempo, energy) using Spotify API

Support user-based filtering and preferences

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
